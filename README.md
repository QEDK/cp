## QEDK/cp
CodeChef solutions and tidbits...
### What is this?
A collection of my solutions to competitive programming questions.
### Can I use this?
Sure, just follow the GPL license (and keep in mind that plagiarising source codes for contests would essentially disqualify you). 
### How do I use this?
The file name is the code for the question on the site. That's all.
### What can I use this for?
Practice, improving your solutions, not a lot.
### What does "*ios_base....*" mean?
A standard CP method to enable fast I/O. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31162367/significance-of-ios-basesync-with-stdiofalse-cin-tienull for exact clarification. It IS **C++-specific**.
### Why do I use C++ only?
Because it is the best option for CP. C++ comes with STL (Standard Template Library) while most do not. Remember that other languages might offer better options depending on the solution required. Other popular languages for CP are Java, C and Python, do check them out.
### What are some good sites to get into CP?
CodeChef, Codeforces, Topcoder, Project Euler... the list goes on.
